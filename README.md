# Malloc
Software developers recode their own C-language versions of the classic functions Malloc, Realloc and Free. This process forms the basis of a dynamic memory management system. Implementation strategies usually involve multiple data structures (two-dimensional linked list, hash tables, Black&Red or AVL tree). Software developers track and update all user memory requests on the heap in real time. These requests include the following: new memory allocations, expansion of existing allocations, fragmentation handling, and recycling. Malloc requires a high level of creative debugging, error management, and speed optimization.

## Allowed functions:
`mmap`, `munmap`, `getpagesize`, `getrlimit`.
## Keywords
C language, dynamic memory management, optimization, prototyping, debugging, error management.
