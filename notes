An allocator must keep track of which parts of the memory are in use, and which parts are free.
The goal of the allocator design is usually to minimize wasted space without undue time cost, or vice versa.
The ideal allocator would spend negligible time managing memory and waste negligible space.

Based on the C standard (C17 7.22.3/1):
If the size of the space requested is zero, the behavior is implementation defined: either a null pointer is returned,
or the behavior is as if the size were some nonzero value, except that the returned pointer shall not be used to access an object.
